Technical Code for SNUC Connect
Problem: Inefficient Event Management & Discovery System
1)Unorganized Communication – Events are shared via WhatsApp and Outlook emails, leading to scattered information.
2)Slow Information Spread – Messages get buried in chats or emails, making it hard for students to stay updated.
3)Lack of Centralization – No single platform exists for students to browse and register for events often relying on Google forms and Outlook which is not always reliable if the events are conducted on a larger scale. Example:- INSTINCTS, MELA, NOVA etc..
4)Low Engagement & Awareness – Many students miss events due to inconsistent notifications, leading to low participation rates thereby reducing the hype of certain events
5)No Real-time Updates – Last-minute changes or reminders are not efficiently communicated.
6) Limited RSVP Tracking – Organizers struggle to track interested students and attendance.
7)No Personalized Recommendations – Students don’t receive event suggestions based on their interests.
8) No Gamification & Incentives – No reward system to encourage participation and engagement. Students are rather confused on how to become a proper member of a certain club they are interested in and rise through its ranks. There is no proper ranking system for clubs, that causes this confusion.
